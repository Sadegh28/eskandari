# About
I'm broadly interested in machine learning. I am currently an Assistant Professor at University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran. 
I recieved my PhD in applied mathematics from Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, under supervision of professor Mohammad Masoud Javidi. Before that, I spent a six month at Middle East Technical University (METU),  working with professor Emre Akbas[http://user.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~emre/].
